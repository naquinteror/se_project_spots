### Description

Spots is an interactive social media web application where users can add and remove photos, like photos from other users, and make minor adjustments to their profiles. For this project, we worked with a Figma design that provided layouts for mobile (320px) and desktop (1440px). The goal was to make the webpage responsive, displaying three cards per row and centering the layout on desktop view, with a maximum width of 1280px. If the browser window is larger than this, there will be space on either side of the pageâ€™s content.
On mobile devices, the profile will display only one card per row, with a minimum supported screen width of 320px.
